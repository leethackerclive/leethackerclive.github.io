## Pyongyang trip!

Just came back from my great DPRK trip!

We could certainly learn a lot: they're so friendly there. Some guy I had only known for a few days asked to come back with me! But his boss said he was too busy to leave, which must have been true, because I didn't see him again. Maybe next time?
